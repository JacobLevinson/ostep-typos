Page 15 (Summary):
At the end, the summary mentions recent innovations
including flash-based SSDs and Intel Optane.
Unfortunately, as of part of Intel's Q2 2022 earnings
call, they announced they would be discontinuing 
Optane, which should perhaps be reflected here. 
(In fact, it seems as if all 3D XPoint memory is 
canceled). Perhaps newer technologies being used such
as Samsung Z-NAND or those being researched such as
PCM, RRAM, and MRAM could be mentioned instead.
